Hello and Welcome to my personal Blog.
I setup this blog course **ELEC4630** and to post some progress about what I will learn about `fastai`.
Edit the `index.md` file to change this content. All pages on the blog, including this one, use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). You can include images:

## This is a title

And you can include links, like this [link to fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai). Posts will appear after this file.
