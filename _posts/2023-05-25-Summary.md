# Summary about what I learnt from this assignment
## Part 1
In this part, I learnt how to set up my first personal blog and modify some setting to make it interesting, such as how to insert images, to add a link and to use different font to show something different. And i just followed the instruction to finish this task.

## Part 2
Part2 is to study an example and make it clear how to classify different images into different categories. The example is a binary problem but we can further develop and modify it into more complicated issues like what the assignment aksed us to.

It is also not that difficult becasue the **change form 0 to 1 is always harder than the change from 1 to 10**.

The new thing I learnt here is how to evaluate a model based on different criteria, such as:

*Confusion Matrix*

*t-SNE method*

Also I tried different ways aiming to improve the results, such as increase the number of epochs or use a resnet model with more layers. Some work and some don't. To get a better result, a lot can be done.

## Part 3
This is a challenging problem to identify AI-generated image and real images. I referred some works by others and based on some pre-trained model, I tried to build a new model to test, find the difference and evaluate. As I mentioned in the notebook, I can't say I designed a model, I just tested and tried to build. But I still learnt a lot. I think I talked a lot in the notebook about:

**The difference between AI-images and real images**

**USe AI to detecet AI-generated images**

**Build a model**

**Evaluate a model**

**How to improve**

## Other things worthy mentioned
I am a new comer to AI and not so good at coding. So I tried my best(my wife can witness for me). 

This is my  first time to use Github and codespace to develop a repository and manage. 

I also learnt how to print notebooks into PDF files.
## Acknowledgement

Thanks for Professor Lovell to build the enviroment for AI, which enables us to just focus on the studying of fastai.

And also thanks to all the tutors, especially Yidi, due to her help from Ed discussion and response of email, I solved some problems.
