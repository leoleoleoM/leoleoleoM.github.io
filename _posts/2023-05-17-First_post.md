# My first github blog post

This is my first post and as this is close to the end of this semester, I am just about to deal with this assignment **/(ㄒoㄒ)/** Sad story.
## Progress today
I learnt how to establish the personal blog and edit homepage. Then how to publish the first post and my wife is really satisfied to the picture I choose.
I also explain why my github username is leoleoleoM cuz ***leo Messi is the best football player I have ever seen***.
## Next step plan
Part 1 is always easy to start and next I will deal with animal classification problem. Well, I will try my best.
## Summary
Github is new to me. As well as *fastai*.
